I didn't do much, if any, noteworthy refactoring until my assignment was feature-complete, 
    so consider commit #14 (https://github.com/E-Gantz/501A2/tree/6796c7a0a0b8f9787cdc92c01a13a74b1401df3c) the initial commit for the refactoring phase.
The main bad smell was long methods that were doing too much, 
    so the first steps in refactoring were to break those up into smaller methods.
I felt that my inspect method was doing too much work, getting the various method, field, constructor, etc. arrays and looping through them,
    so I extracted this functionality out into helper methods. (https://github.com/E-Gantz/501A2/tree/c86e48a675f797ff5e422bd4c69627d3d1a3253a)
Next, it looked like inspectField was a bit long and was essentially operating in two modes: handling an array and not handling an array,
    so I extracted the 'handling an array' functionality into its own method. (https://github.com/E-Gantz/501A2/tree/fd452787998af0399651b9cbf4f08027740ab1fa)
At this point the code looked good to me so I got everything ready for submission
