I didn't do much, if any, noteworthy refactoring until my assignment was feature-complete, so consider commit #14 (https://github.com/E-Gantz/501A2/tree/6796c7a0a0b8f9787cdc92c01a13a74b1401df3c) the initial commit for the refactoring phase.
The main bad smell was long methods that were doing too much, so the first steps in refactoring were to break those up into smaller methods.
I felt that my inspect method was doing too much work, getting the various method, field, constructor, etc. arrays and looping through them,
    so I extracted this functionality out into helper methods.
